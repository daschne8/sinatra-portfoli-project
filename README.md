Sinatra Portfolio Project:

Simple CMS example for displaying User accounts and their associated video game data. Uses a ruby wrapper for the Steam WebApi to get some seed data.  Has displays for developers, genres, users, and games.  The steam api doesn't like to give very much information so nokogiri had to also be used and some information still needs to be entered manually.

Prerequisites/installing:
everything you need to run the project is obtainable through the gemfile and running bundle install

Built With:
Sinatra,
steam-api,
nokogiri
